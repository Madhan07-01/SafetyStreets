import React from 'react';

// Minimal VoiceActivation component.
// Replace with real logic if needed (e.g., speech recognition hooks).
export function VoiceActivation(props) {
  return null; // Placeholder to satisfy imports as a named symbol.
}

// If you prefer named exports instead, you could do:
// (Already using named export). Adjust imports to:
// import { VoiceActivation } from '@/components/dashboard/emergency/voiceactivation';
